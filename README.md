# CoronaHack--Chest-X-Ray
This project is based on artificial neural network in deep learning. Aim of this project is to predict whether the person is effected by corona virus. The prediction is based on analyzing chest x-ray of human body.

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/praveengovi/coronahack-chest-xraydataset
Corona - COVID19 virus affects the respiratory system of healthy individual & Chest X -Ray is one of the important imaging methods to identify the corona virus.

With the Chest X - Ray dataset, Develop a Machine Learning Model to classify the X Rays of Healthy vs Pneumonia (Corona) affected patients & this model powers the AI application to test the Corona Virus in Faster Phase.

Collection Chest X Ray of Healthy vs Pneumonia (Corona) affected patients infected patients along with few other categories such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ) ,Streptococcus & ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome)

Images name and labels are available in ChestXrayCorona_Metadata.csv

Here i have make djnago projet and in backend running out deep learning model. When you upload an x-ray image it predit and give you result whether it is positive or negative.
